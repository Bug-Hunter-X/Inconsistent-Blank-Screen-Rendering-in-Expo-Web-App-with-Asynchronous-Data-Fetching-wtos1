This bug occurs when using the Expo Web SDK and routing within the application.  When navigating to a screen, if the component uses a method to fetch data and this method has an asynchronous operation, there is a possibility that the component might render before the data has been fetched. This leads to a blank or partially rendered screen. The error doesn't always manifest, making it difficult to debug and reproduce consistently.  This is worsened by asynchronous operations within the component's useEffect hooks.
